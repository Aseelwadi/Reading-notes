# Review
 * Most organisations or businesses will either use a web agency to design and build their website or, if they have their own web teams, they will build it in-house.

    The client will decide how much money they want to spend on building the website, how long they have to build it and also how the website will be maintained once it is built. The web team will then take this information and produce a production plan for the client to agree before they start work on the site.
    Sometimes a client will ask many web agencies to ‘pitch’ for the work. This means that web agencies will come up with ideas and present them to the client. The client then picks the web agency they would like to work with.

* Your average visitor may not notice them in the finished product, but to a web developer, those little bits of HTML and CSS code is all they have put together the final show. HTML5 and CSS3 gives a web developer even more tools with which to express himself, here is a basic overview of what they are so you can build cutting edge websites.

* ### What is Website Structure?
A website’s structure (sometimes referred to as the taxonomy) is a way to organise a website’s content.

When you visit a website with a top navigation menu, this is the website’s main structure from which most of the subcategories and topics will branch out from.

It’s particularly important to establish a solid website architecture if your website has lots of content, whether that is pages, products, blog posts or topics.

Think of a website’s structure as the content page of a reference book. You have the book itself (the homepage), the chapters (categories) and topics (sub-categories, blog posts or pages). A good site structure leaves a user in no doubt as to where to go to find the content they need.

 # HTML5 Layout
 ___
 * HTML5 is an upgrade from HTML 4.01 version, that has many new features, advanced functional features, better page views, and many other improvements to match the growing technological needs. The most used and desired elements of HTML5 are 
 > figure, figcaption, article, header,
 > main,mark,footer, nav, aside,hggroup, section 
 > and summary 

  . These tags/ elements of HTML 5 enables far more user friendly interfaces, with higher performance rates, efficient outcomes, easier to code and implement, and it helps in improvising the layout as a whole.

 * ### Using New HTML5 Elements In Old Browsers
 HTML 5 is a great update for HTML it comes with so many new elements to use in web design but unfortunately with advances in technology comes problems when those advances need to work with older technologies such as older browser versions like internet explorer 6, this means if someone is using your website on IE then it will be completely broken because IE doesn’t recognize the HTML5 element code. This does mean you shouldn’t use it though, there are some work abounds to fix it, for example there is a tool called ‘The HTML5 Shiv’ this tool allows the designer to style a HTML5 element that wont work on older browsers thus making it work now. The way HTML5 Shiv does this is through Java script It simply involves calling document.createElement() for every new, unrecognized element.
