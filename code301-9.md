## What is functional programming

* Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## Pure functions

* It returns the same result if given the same arguments
  * ` let PI = 3.14; `
    ` const calculateArea = (radius) => radius * radius * PI; `
    ` calculateArea(10); // returns 314.0 `
* It does not cause any observable side effects
  * `let counter = 1;`
    `function increaseCounter(value) {`
    `counter = value + 1;}`
    `increaseCounter(counter);`
    `console.log(counter); // 2`

 __pure functions__:
 - It returns the same result if given the same arguments.
 - It does not cause any observable side effects.

  - EX:  impure function:
    - let PI = 3.14;
    - const calculateArea = (radius) => radius * radius * PI;
    - calculateArea(10); // returns 314.0


- __Immutability__:
- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.
- If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t.
- Instead, you create a new object with the new value.



## Referential transparency

* Basically, if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
  * ` pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency `



## Standards

* There is no doubt that standards help to improve the quality of code. It’s important to check for those standards while refactoring your code
