# Node.js

![](https://www.webrexstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Node-js.jpg)
**Node.js** is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

**Node.js** is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

## Notes :

1. **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
2. **The V8 engine** is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. it's responsible for compiling JS code.
3. It's better to install NVM(Node Version Manager), in case you have to install different versions of node JS.
4. To install nvm please follow it's original repo [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script)
5. To check the node versions you have, type **nvm ls**
6. To install a certain version of nvm, type **nvm install -version-** 
7. To use a node version other than the one you are using, type **nvm use -version-**.
8. Please refer to this page for deploying nvm [nvm guide](https://www.sitepoint.com/quick-tip-multiple-versions-node-nvm/)
9. We use npm to install node packages.
10. When installing node packages it will create a file **package.json**, and it will contain all the packages we installed.

### Installing jshint package Globally

```
npm install -g jshint
```

then adding 

``` js
/* jshint esversion: 6 */
```

at the top of JS file.

### Working with the package.json File

```
npm install
```

Node.js speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases.
