# Text Editor

A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software, following

the naming of Microsoft Notepad. Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code.

 # The defiance between text editor and code editor

A text editor just display plain text in one color (black on white, usually, often with monospaced font), with more or less advanced facilities (search, replace, perhaps with regexes, macros / automation, etc.). A good text editor might be optimized to handle very large files, etc.

A code editor is, of course, able to do all of the above, and more. The "more" part is, unsurprisingly, aimed at editing source code (programs, textual data like Json or XML, etc.).

Often, it offers syntax highlighting, code snippets, autocompletion, perhaps simple error detection (like unclosed string), more advanced navigation (jump to matching brace / bracket / parenthesis / tag), perhaps auto-indentation, etc.

Advanced text editors, like Atom, are almost IDEs, ie. integrated development environment: they can analyze code, jump to the definition of a function from its call, show advanced

#  Command line

Windows command line, command screen, or text interface, is a user interface that's navigated by typing commands at prompts, instead of using a mouse. For example, the Windows folder in a Windows command line is "C:\Windows>" (as shown in the picture). In Unix or Linux, it may be "%" or ">" depending on the shell. Unlike a GUI (graphical user interface) operating system, a command line only uses a keyboard to navigate by entering commands and does not utilize a mouse for navigating.

Linux is an Extensionless System
This one can sometimes be hard to get your head around but as you work through the sections it will start to make more sense. A file extension is normally a set of 2 - 4 characters after a full stop at the end of a file, which denotes what type of file it is. The following are common extensions:

file.exe - an executable file, or program.
file.txt - a plain text file.
file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
In other systems such as Windows the extension is important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is. Under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is. So for instance I could have a file myself.png which is a picture of me. I could rename the file to myself.txt or just myself and Linux would still happily treat the file as an

image file. As such it can sometimes be hard to know for certain what type of file a particular file is. Luckily there is a command called file which we can use to find this out.
