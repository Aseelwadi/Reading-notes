## Some OF Pair Programming Advantages
* Two heads are better than one.

 If the driver encounters a hitch with the code, there will be two of them who’ll solve the problem.

 * More efficient. 
 
 Common thinking is that it slows down the project completion time because you are effectively putting two programmers to develop a single program, instead of having them work independently on two different programs. But studies have shown that two programmers working on the same program are only 15% slower than when these programmers work independently, rather than the presupposed 50% slow down.

 * Develops your staff’s interpersonal skills. 
 
 Collaborating on a single project helps your team to appreciate the value of communication and teamwork.
