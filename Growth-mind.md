# Growth mindset
## What Is a Growth Mindset?

A growth mindset is simply the belief that our
 basic abilities can be developed,
 and improved through dedication and hard work
 . It's not so much that this belief is some kind of magic. It's just that without a growth mindset, we don't exert the required effort and so we remain perpetually stuck.
