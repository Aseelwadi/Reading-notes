##  What is Mustache?
Mustache is a simple template system that you can use when building websites and web apps. By using a template system, you can keep your back-end code separate from the markup that displays the front end to the user. This clean separation gives you many advantages. For example, it makes it easy for a designer to work on a website’s visual design without the risk of messing up the site’s code. It also makes it easy for you to change the design at a later point without impacting the back-end code.
## Templating with Mustache
- JavaScript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with JavaScript using a JSON data source
- Template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will insert variablesor run programming logic
- Template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client
- Moustache: a logic-less template syntax, works by expanding tags in a templateusing values provided in a hash or object- Logic-less because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops, instead there are only tags
- mustache.js is implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript
- Mustace is not a templating engine, but a specification for a templating language
- If you use mustache with Node and Express, you can use mustache-express

### Flexbox is a single dimensional layout, which means that it lays items in one dimension at a time, either as a row, or as a column, but not both together. This can be opposed to the two-dimensional model - CSS Grid Layout, which lays the items in two dimensions simultaneously (rows and columns together).
- Parent element (flex container)
```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```
- Child element (flex items)
```css
.item {
  order: 5; /* default is 0 */
}
```

### Features of Flexbox
Following are the notable features of Flexbox layout −

- Direction − You can arrange the items on a web page in any direction such as left to right, right to left, top to bottom, and bottom to top.

- Order − Using Flexbox, you can rearrange the order of the contents of a web page.

- Wrap − In case of inconsistent space for the contents of a web page (in single line), you can wrap them to multiple lines (both horizontally) and vertically.

- Alignment − Using Flexbox, you can align the contents of the webpage with respect to their container.

- Resize − Using Flexbox, you can increase or decrease the size of the items in the page to fit in available space.
