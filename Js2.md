# Loops : 

Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.

* syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

1-	Foor loop 

2-	While loop 

# Foor loop

## The syntax of for loop is 

 ```js

 for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}


for (inti ; condetion; update)
{
Statements 
}
```
* Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.

* Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.

* Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

 ________________
 # The While Loop
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## Syntax
 ```js
Init ;
while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed(Update)
update
}  
```

 # Comparing For and While
 BASIS FOR COMPARISON	 |FOR	| WHILE
 ------------------------|------|-----
 Declaration |	for(initialization; condition; iteration){//body of 'for' loop}	|while ( condition) {statements; //body of loop}
 Format | 	Initialization, condition checking, iteration statement are written at the top of the loop.	  | Only initialization and condition checking is done at the top of the loop.
 Use |	The 'for' loop used only when we already knew the number of iterations.	|The 'while' loop used only when the number of iteration are not exactly known.
 Condition |	If the condition is not put up in 'for' loop, then loop iterates infinite times.|	If the condition is not put up in 'while' loop, it provides compilation error.
 Initialization	 | In 'for' loop the initialization once done is never repeated.|	In while loop if initialization is done during condition checking, then initialization is done each time the loop iterate.

 ## JavaScript Comparison Operators
Operator |	Descriptio
---------|------------
== |	equal to
===	| equal value and equal type
!= | 	not equal
!==	| not equal value or not equal type
">"	| greater than
<	| less than
">=" | 	greater than or equal to
<= |	less than or equal to
?  |	ternary operator
